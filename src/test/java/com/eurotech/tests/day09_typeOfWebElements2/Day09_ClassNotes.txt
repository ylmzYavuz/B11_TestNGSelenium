Day09_Type Of Web Elements_2

	FindElements
		We have been trying to locate one element until now. We will learn how to locate multiple elements and interact with.

		List Of Elements
			driver.findElements()
			We are going to use one locator, but with it, we will get more than one element.
			findElements() method returns list of webElements.
			We locate the element in one shot.
			Use common locators for the elements that you want to locate.
			Pass your locator to findElements() method;
			List<WebElement> listElements=driver.findElements(By......)
			If you are using findElements() method, first check the size always.
			Because, it returns true even if your locator is false —> listElement.size() = 0
			findElements() —> does NOT throw NoSuchElementException if your locator is wrong, it returns empty list.

	DropDown
		We have 2 different way to handle dropdown
		Select Class
			Select —>html tag
			Select Class —> class from selenium
			If dropdown starts with select tag / has select class, this is easy way.
			select class comes from selenium.
			Usually, only one is allowed to be chosen from the dropdown.
			Select class only works with webElement which has select tag.

			How to use Select Class?
			1.  Be sure that the dropdown has select tag
			2.  Locate the dropdown just like another elements
			3.  Create object using Select class by passing the element that we locate step 2 as a constructor.

			SELECT methods
				getOptions() --> returns all text available options from the dropdown list.
				getFirstSelectedOption()--> return webElement, first selected option

			HOW TO SELECT OPTION FROM DROPDOWN
				1.  Using Visible Text
				selectByVisibleText("text") -->selecting based on the visible text of options
				2.  Using index Number
				selectByIndex(indexNumber) -->select based on index of options(starts from 0)
				3.  Using value attribute's value
				selectByValue(option value) --> select based on value of value attribute

	No Select Dropdown
		When we try to use Select class with the dropdown which does not have select tag we got UnexpectedTagNameException: Element should have been "select" but was “div"
		If we don’t have select tag we locate dropdown just like any other elements and see options with clicking or hovering over to it.
		To get all options from dropdown we can use common locator between them(exp: classname, tag name etc) then we can use list methods to get the size and expected options list.
		We use click() method to click different options, we can either locate the options separately or use index of the options from list.
