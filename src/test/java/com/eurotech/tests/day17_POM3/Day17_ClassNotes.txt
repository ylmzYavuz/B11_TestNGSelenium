  POM
1. What is POM?
    Page Object Model, also known as POM, is a design pattern in Selenium that
    creates an object repository for storing all web elements. It helps reduce code
    duplication and improves test case maintenance.
    In Page Object Model, consider each web page of an application as a class file.
    Each class file will contain only corresponding web page elements. Using these
    elements, testers can perform operations on the website under test.
2. Why it is useful?
    - Clean code, everything has a place
    - Configuration.properties
    - Pages (inc TestBase, BasePage)
    - Utilities
    - Driver (Singleton)
    - Easy to maintain
    - Easy to read
    We are not on our own, to work collaboratively in a structured way
